			<h1>Sunglasses</h1>
			<p class="description-text">Glasses, commonly known as spectacles or eyeglasses, are optical devices designed to improve and correct vision. They consist of lenses mounted in a frame that sits on the nose and ears. The primary purpose of glasses is to compensate for refractive errors in the eyes, such as nearsightedness (myopia), farsightedness (hyperopia), and astigmatism.<br><br>
                The lenses of glasses are typically made from glass or various types of plastic, and they can have different coatings to enhance clarity, reduce glare, or provide UV protection. Frames come in a wide variety of materials, including metal, plastic, and a combination of both. The design of frames can range from classic and conservative to modern and trendy, catering to diverse aesthetic preferences.<br><br>Beyond their functional role in vision correction, glasses have become a significant fashion accessory. Many people choose frames that complement their personal style, making a fashion statement while addressing their visual needs. Additionally, some glasses are designed for specific activities, such as reading glasses for close-up tasks or sunglasses for UV protection and glare reduction in bright sunlight.<br><br>

                In recent years, technology has also brought forth innovations like anti-blue light coatings on lenses to reduce eye strain caused by prolonged exposure to digital screens. Overall, glasses serve both practical and aesthetic purposes, playing a crucial role in enhancing visual acuity and contributing to individual expressions of style.</p>
